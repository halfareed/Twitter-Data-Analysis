# Twitter-Data-Analysis


### Project Purpose    
 
The goal of this mid-semester project is to work with Twitter API to analyze tweets from a person, and in this case, Former President Donald Trump.  @RealDonaldTrump tweets provide a great opportunity to understand how online media can be used to communicate over the traditional media. In fact, social media post are so influential, now the traditional media spends considerable amount of time discussing social media posts. Tweets from people such as Donald Trump and Elon Musk have become so consequential, they can move the stock market on short term and get network TV to debate and discuss hours and hours about what Trump or Musk meant.

this project will analyze range of emotions, hope, controversy, vagueness that are part of Trump tweets. We are interested in seeing what we can draw from US Presidents tweets. 
* DISCLAIMER: This project is not designed with any bias in mind. Note that we could pick any person (Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump or Elon Musk) or anyone else to do the same analysis.
